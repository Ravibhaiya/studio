# **App Name**: Math Tools

## Core Features:

- Blank Slate: Provide users with a completely blank digital canvas upon initialization. Let users generate everything by prompt, one item at a time, via generative AI.
- Generative Drawing: Enable users to prompt individual items on the canvas, one at a time. Position of the drawing is also user-specified. AI tool analyzes prompts and uses DALL-E to fill the prompt on the canvas.
- Layer Management: Allow users to organize drawings on different layers for easier manipulation and control, for the layering and overlapping of objects.
- Item editing: Allow users to resize, rotate or reposition the object after initial drawing
- Prompt History: Display a history of all the prompts that generated an image, with an associated visual thumbnail
- Export Functionality: Enable users to export their canvases in common image formats (e.g., JPG, PNG).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) for a creative yet calming ambiance.
- Background color: Light Grayish-Indigo (#E8EAF6), providing a subtle backdrop that doesn't distract from the canvas.
- Accent color: Vivid Orange (#FF9800) to draw attention to key interactive elements like prompt inputs or export buttons.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for the body text. Space Grotesk is perfect for titles and shorter text while 'Inter' offers excellent readability for descriptions and other detailed information.
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for display of prompt histories or command inputs.
- Simple, outlined icons that are intuitive and do not clutter the interface.
- A clean, minimal layout with the canvas taking center stage, surrounded by discreet controls and options.
- Subtle animations when objects are added or edited on the canvas, providing visual feedback without being distracting.
